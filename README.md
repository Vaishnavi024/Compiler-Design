## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Jugaad" project, a unique venture in the world of programming languages. This README file will provide you with a brief insight into what "Jugaad" is all about.

### Project Details

- **Project Title:** Toy Programming Language in Hindi/Gen Z Slang
- **Course:** Compiler Design
- **Instructor:** Saurabh Shanu
- **Student:** Vaishnavi Srivastava
- **SAP ID:** 500095279
- **Batch:** B.Tech CSE Blockchain

### 1. What is the name of the language?

The name of the language is "Jugaad," a popular term among the Indian youth and deeply rooted in Indian culture. It embodies the spirit of making things work cleverly and innovatively, which is precisely what this language aims to do.

### 2. What language are you building and how is it different?

"Jugaad" is a toy programming language built from scratch using the C language as its foundation. It offers basic functionalities such as printing, looping, and conditionals, with a syntax framework similar to C or Java. However, what sets "Jugaad" apart is its unique twist: some of the keywords of the language are in Hindi Gen Z slang. This adds a fun and appealing dimension, making it more relatable to the new generation and easy to remember. To truly embody its name, "Jugaad" also includes in-built functions for commonly needed tasks, such as counting frequency.


### Project Timeline

The project is expected to be completed by December 2023.

### 3. Language Being Used

I am implementing "Jugaad" using the C programming language.

Thank you for showing interest in "Jugaad."
